## BackendCookieMitigation.ps1

This mitigation will filter https requests that contain malicious X-AnonResource-Backend and malformed X-BEResource cookies which were found to be used in the SSRF attacks in the wild.
This will help with defense against the known patterns observed but not the SSRF as a whole. For more information, see the comments at the top of the script.

The most typical usage of this script is to check all Exchange servers and save the output,
by using the following syntax from Exchange Management Shell:

`Get-ExchangeServer | .\Test-ProxyLogon.ps1 -OutPath $home\desktop\logs`

To check the local server only, just run the script:

`.\Test-ProxyLogon.ps1 -OutPath $home\desktop\logs`

To display the results without saving them, drop the -Outpath parameter from either example above:

`.\Test-ProxyLogon.ps1`
